    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p> Sixteen years after making history, Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail Thursday for the 2024 presidential election with the hope of helping Vice President Kamala Harris do the same.</p>
    <h2>The former president headlined a Harris campaign rally in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, where he leaned into how the contest is about character and values as much as policy differences. The event kicks off a series of rallies in battleground states for the VP and other down ballot candidates through November.</h2>
